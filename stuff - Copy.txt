SCRIPTING KNOWLEDGE Based Questions: Submit the answers with the questions in an attachment.

Perl- 
1.)	Create a Script that would read a file. Instructions are as follows: Take an input of a filename and output will be the content inside a file. (ex perl perla.txt document.txt) and it will read the content of document.txt
	Script in script.pl:
		While (<>) {
			Print;
			}
	perl script.pl file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

	This will display all content inside file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt

2.)	Create a Script that would do Arthimetic Operations. Instructions are as follows: Prompt the user for entering two numerical value inputs which will be used for Arthimetics. Prompt the user for entering the Arthimetic Operation Value,1 for addition, 2 for multiply.  Based on what the user has inputed, it will perform the Arthimetic Operations. 
             Check for Bugs: If a user enters negative values, alphabetic values and display errors.

	Script in script.pl
		print "Enter first number :";
		chomp($num1 =<STDIN>);
		while ($num1=~/\D/){
			print "Enter a valid number :";
			chomp($num1 =<STDIN>);
			}
		print "Enter Second number :";
		chomp($num2 =<STDIN>);
		while ($num2=~/\D/){
			print "Enter a valid number :";
			chomp($num2 =<STDIN>);
			}

		print "Choose operation : 1 for addition , 2 for multiplication : ";
		chomp($oper=<STDIN>);

		while ($oper!~/[12]/){
		print "Enter a valid operation :";
		chomp($oper =<STDIN>);
		}

		if ($oper==1){
			&Add;
		} elsif ($oper==2) {
		&Multi;
		}
		sub Add{
		$add=$num1+$num2;
		print " Sum of $num1 and $num2 is : $add";
		}

		sub Multi {
		$multi=$num1*$num2;
		print " Multiplication of $num1 and $num2 is : $multi"; 
		}

3.)	Create a Script that would output even lines: Instructions are as follows: Take an input of a file and output all even lines only. Hint, Use Push and Pop or use While loop.

4.)	Create a Script that would output first and last line. Instructions are as follows: Create a txt file that has atleast 5 lines.  Execute this through perl program that would display the first and last line from txt file.

1.)	What is the termination of an If loop statement?
2.)	How would you pass an argument to a shell script? Give an example
3.)	How would you take arguments within a shell script? Give an example
4.)	What does 2 >&1 mean?
5.)	Write down the syntax of “for” loop
